This is about how to use nomral distribution and fully connected network to predict whether a person's income over 50K per year or not.

The nn file is fully connected network
 and the gr file is probability forecasting model
 
 We take 10% data to train the model and 90% to test
 
 The result shows fully connected network enjoy 0.89 predict accuracy and probability forecasting model enjoys 0.07 predict accuracy
